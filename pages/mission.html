          <p>
            We are a dedicated and passionate civil association committed to
            rescuing and rehabilitating horses in need. Our organization was
            founded with the goal of providing a safe haven for horses that have
            been mistreated, neglected, or abandoned, and to raise awareness in
            society about the mistreatment of equines.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our team of dedicated volunteers and staff work tirelessly to
            provide the best possible care for every horse that comes into our
            care. We provide medical treatment, rehabilitation, and training to
            help these beautiful creatures recover from their past experiences
            and find new homes with loving families.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="article-right">
          <p>
            In addition to our rescue and rehabilitation efforts, we are also
            dedicated to raising awareness about the issue of animal blood
            traction and equine slaughter. We believe that education and
            advocacy are key to creating a world in which all horses are treated
            with kindness, respect, and dignity.
          </p>
          <p>
            We invite you to join us in our mission. Whether you can donate your
            time, resources, or simply spread the word about our work, every
            little bit helps. Together, we can create a brighter future for
            horses in need. We look forward to working with you to make a
            positive difference in the lives of horses everywhere!
