        <p>
          We are a dedicated and passionate civil association committed to
          rescuing and rehabilitating horses in need. Our organization was
          founded with the goal of providing a safe haven for horses that have
          been mistreated, neglected, or abandoned, and to raise awareness in
          society about the mistreatment of equines. Our team of dedicated
          volunteers and staff work tirelessly to provide the best possible care
          for every horse that comes into our care. We provide medical
          treatment, rehabilitation, and training to help these beautiful
          creatures recover from their past experiences and find new homes with
          loving families.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to our rescue and rehabilitation efforts, we are also
          dedicated to raising awareness about the issue of animal blood
          traction and equine slaughter. We believe that education and advocacy
          are key to creating a world in which all horses are treated with
          kindness, respect, and dignity. We invite you to join us in our
          mission. Whether you can donate your time, resources, or simply spread
          the word about our work, every little bit helps. Together, we can
          create a brighter future for horses in need. We look forward to
          working with you to make a positive difference in the lives of horses
          everywhere!
